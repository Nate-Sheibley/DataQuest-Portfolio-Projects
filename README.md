## Analysis of 11 Forest Fire factors for relation to frequency and intensity
### [R-visualizations_forest_fire_metrics](/R-visualizations_forest_fire_metrics)
Use tidyverse packages to transform and load data from a CSV, then make complex visualizations to aid in discovering which forest fire factors correlate strongly with increase frequency of fire, or increased intensity (using area burned as a proxy)

# About DataQuest Guided projects

DataQuest guided projects provide a dataset, and a target for analysis.

DataQuest provides vidualization snippets and/or implementation metrics to allow for checking milestone progreess.

Largely, the student is responsible for sanity checking the analysis.

Example1: In the python-mapReduce project they provided the implementation metric: execution time for each method.

Example2: In the R-visualizations-forest-fire-metrics project, DataQuest provided two months with highest fire frequency, and .png examples of one of the plots.
  They do not provide any code or code base.

DataQuest started Sept 2023

Initial commit Mar 2024
